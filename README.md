# Salvator Mundi

**Salvator Mundi** is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci dated to c. 1500.

The painting depicts Jesus in Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as *Salvator Mundi* (Latin for 'Savior of the World') and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens.[

My intention is to create an app that would show this famous painting in a 3D rendering.
